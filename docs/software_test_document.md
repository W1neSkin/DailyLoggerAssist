## 1. Test Strategy (Updated)
- Verify all microservices and frontend meet functional requirements
- Ensure system reliability, performance, and security
- Validate inter-service contracts via API Gateway
- Confirm AI processing accuracy
- Test external service integrations
- Use CI/CD for automated test execution

---

## 2. Test Types (Updated)
- **Unit Tests**: Each microservice, shared code, and frontend components
- **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service, database, and external APIs
- **Contract Tests**: API Gateway â†” Microservices, OpenAPI schema validation
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Full user workflows via frontend and API Gateway
- **Frontend Tests**: React component/unit, integration, and E2E (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
- **Performance/Security Tests**: Load, rate limiting, auth, input validation

---

## 3. Test Environment (Updated)
- Use Docker Compose to spin up all services and frontend for integration/E2E tests
- Use test-specific databases and Redis instances
- Mock external APIs (Teams, Email, JIRA) for repeatable tests
- Use `.env.test` for test configuration

---

## 4. Test Cases (Updated)
- **Authentication**: Register, login, token refresh, logout, session invalidation
- **User Management**: Profile CRUD, password change, access control
- **Work Items**: CRUD, time tracking, search/filter, status updates
- **Reports**: Generation, template management, export, analytics
- **Integrations**: Teams/Email/JIRA sync, error handling
- **AI Processing**: Content analysis, task suggestions, smart categorization
- **Notifications**: Email/webhook delivery, retry logic
- **Frontend**: Page rendering, form validation, API integration, protected routes
- **API Gateway**: Routing, rate limiting, error handling, contract validation

---

## 7. Integration & Contract Testing
- Use OpenAPI schema validation for all service endpoints
- Use contract tests to ensure API Gateway and microservices remain in sync
- Use pytest + httpx for service-to-service and gateway tests
- Use Pact or similar for contract testing if needed

---

## 8. Frontend (React) Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for components, hooks, utils
- **Integration Tests**: Test Redux store, API slices, and component flows
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for full user flows (login, dashboard, work items, reports)
- **Mock API**: Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) for frontend API mocking
- **Coverage**: >90% for critical components/pages

---

## 9. Test Automation
- All tests run in CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)
- Use coverage reports to enforce quality gates
- Use Docker Compose for integration/E2E test orchestration
- Use Sentry for error monitoring in production
